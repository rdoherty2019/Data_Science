    " - **Submission**\n",
    "    * Students submit their homework and projects on Gradescope. However, students are not responsible for submitting their labs on Gradescope. \n",
    "    * Note that Gradescope supports files in Portable Document Format (.pdf). For example, you need to convert files in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb) to Portable Document Format (.pdf) before uploading your submission. See the instructions below for more information on formatting.\n",
    "    * For each question on the assignment, you need to indicate the location of your answer. Failure to map your responses on Gradescope will cause deduction of points. \n",
    " - **Grades**   \n",
    "    * Students access their grades on Gradescope for homework, projects, and labs along with midterm and final. \n",
    "    * Note that you can raise a regrade request through Gradescope. If you encounter an issue with the grading of assignments or exams, then please come to grader office hours to follow up on the regrade request. \n",

    "    * Access JupyterHub with your NYU credentials. Note that you need Multi-Factor Authentication. Please use the Chrome browser\n",
    "    * Under `Control Panel` you can start or stop your server to begin or end a session. Note that `Logout` will not stop your server.\n",
    "    * Sessions are terminated following a half hour of idleness. Session are limited to three hours. You are encouraged to log in before lecture or section to avoid waiting for the server to start the session.    \n",

    "        - `your_materials/`: Copies of the materials from lecture and section including slides and notebooks. You are encouraged to modify these files. Any modifications in the folder will be stored throughout the semester.\n",

    "    * `Assignments` tab\n",
    "        - Besides the `Files` tab, you have the `Assignments` tab. Under the `Assignments` tab you can fetch labs, homework or projects. For example, if your fectch the assignment `Lab1`, then the folder `Lab1` will appear under he `Files` tab.\n",
    " - **Environments**\n",
    "    * Package are installed under the environment `dsua-112`. If you use the `base` environment instead of the `dsua-112` environment you might have missing packages. \n",
    " - **Grading**\n",
    "    * Under the `Assignments` tab you can perform the following actions on your labs, homework and projects \n",
    "        - fetch \n",
    "        - modify \n",
    "        - validate\n",

    " - Searching Piazza for existing posts. Use the folder/filter system\n",
    " - Read the documentation \n",
    " - Searching the Web particularly [forums](https://stackoverflow.com/)\n",
    " - Experiment with different possibilities through trial and error informed by your experiences in class\n",

We want to allow for discussion between students to foster collaboration. In order to make Piazza a better resource for everyone, we've outlined some guidelines for you to follow when posting your questions. Remember that we will increase your letter grade based on participation in class, section, office hour and Piazza. Questions and comments that follow these guidelines contribute to your participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Designated Posts\n",
    "     * Ask assignment questions only in the designated posts. We've created individual posts for each problem. Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those posts only. Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole thread to see if your question has been answered.\n",
    "2. No answers in Posts\n",
    "    * Please don't give away the answer on Piazza. You can explain things in a way that still lets other students figure out the essence of the problem on their own, but don't spoil the problem. If you are not sure about the appropriateness of a post, then post privately to instructors and then we will inform you.\n",
    "3. Try to make Posts Public\n",
    "    * While not divulging answers, try to make your questions public because others might have the same question. \n",
    "4. Posts are not a substittute for Office Hours\n",
    "    * If you think your questions may require lengthy answers, then please come to instructor, teaching assistant or grader office hours.\n",
    "5. Posts are for grading.\n",
    "    * Please do not post questions of the form: \"Is this the correct solution to HW X problem Y?\" or \"Is this the right level of detail for hw X problem Y?\" Please do not use Piazza as a channel for grading. Feel free to ask questions of clarification, or ask questions about the course content to achieve a deeper understanding, but at a certain point, you must apply your knowledge, give it your best shot, and submit your answers with confidence.\n",
    "7. Posts should be self-contained\n",
    "    * Please explain the steps in your reasoning:  \"Starting out, we have: .... Then, I do ..., and I get ... Now, I get confused, and this makes no sense.\" Posting screen shots will help us to understand the bugs"
